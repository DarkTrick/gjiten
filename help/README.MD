Rationales
==========
- Why were makefiles removed?
   Used tool was deprecated; No clear, simple documentation.
- Why was gjiten.1 (probably `man` file base) removed?
   This tool does not work via CLI only. Therefore
   a GUI manual should be enough.
   
TODO:

- Why does `C` have an gjiten.xml, but `ja` has gjiten-doc.ja.html
